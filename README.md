# What-is-a-Programming-Language
A programming language is a formal language used to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute. It allows developers to communicate with machines and create software applications.

ðŸ§  Types of Programming Languages

ðŸ”¹ Low-Level Languages

Closer to machine hardware, harder for humans to read.

Machine Language â€“ Binary code directly executed by the computer.

Assembly Language â€“ Uses symbolic code and is slightly more readable than machine language.

ðŸ”¹ High-Level Languages

Closer to human language, easier to write and understand.

Procedural Languages â€“ Use step-by-step instructions (e.g., C, Pascal).

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€“ Organizes code using objects and classes (e.g., Java, C++, Python).

Non-Procedural Languages â€“ Focus on what to solve, not how (e.g., SQL, Prolog).


ðŸ”¸ Note: OOP allows us to model real-world entities and write code that is more aligned with natural human thinking.

ðŸ§¾ Types of Code

Source Code â€“ The original, human-readable code written in a programming language (e.g., .c, .py, .java).

Object Code â€“ The machine-executable code generated from the source code after compilation (e.g., .exe, .class, .o files).
